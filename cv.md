## About me
I have been programming for about 1 year. During this time, I managed to work in the studio and perform a large multi-page layout project using pug, sass and JS, as an assembler - gulp. In the course I want to learn how to develop in JS. In the future, I plan to develop development on Vue.js.

## Skills
HTML; CSS; Pug; Sass; JS; Gulp; BEM; Git(GitHub); VS code; Vercel;
