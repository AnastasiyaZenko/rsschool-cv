## About me
I have been programming for about 1 year. During this time, I managed to work in the studio and perform a large multi-page layout project using pug, sass and js, as an assembler - gulp. In the course I want to learn how to develop in js. In the future, I plan to develop development on vue.

## Skills
Html; Css; Pug; Sass; Js; Gulp; BEM; Git(github); VS code; Versel;
